// Superglobals are special built-in variables in PHP, that are available from any function, class, or file without previous declaration of them as global variables.

// That practically means, there is no need to use the global keyword to access them.

// Bellow is how we can access a common global variable from a function:

$x = 10;
$y = 2;

function subtract() {
  // Without the global keyword we'd get an 'Undefined variable' notice, and the result would be different (0)
  global $x, $y;
  return $x - $y;
}

echo subtract(); // 8

// Superglobals do not need the global keyword
{
  session_start();
  $_SESSION["newSession"]= 1.1;

  function get_session() {
  // no need for the global keyword
  return $_SESSION["newSession"];
  }

  echo get_session(); // 1.1
}

// We're going to be talking about how the $_SESSION superglobal works later on, but for now just pay attention to how we get access to the global scope without the use of the 'global' keyword.

// There are nine superglobals in PHP.
// These superglobal variables are:

    // $_GLOBALS: It holds a reference to all the global variables that have been defined in a PHP script.
    // $_GET: contains the parameters passed to the script through the query string.
    // $_POST: contains data sent via an HTTP POST request.
    // $_COOKIE: contains data passed to the script as cooky values.
    // $_SESSION: contains data stored in a user's session.
    // $_REQUEST: contains all the data sent by user's client.
    // $_SERVER: contains information about the server.
    // $_ENV: contains information about the environment.

    // Becoming familiar with the basics of each superglobal makes data manipulation in web applications easy and simple.

    // The $_GLOBALS Variable in PHP
    // The $_GLOBALS variable is an associative array that references all variables in global scope, with the variable names being the keys of the array.

    // Let’s see how the $_GLOBALS variable can be used to access a global variable with an example:

$age = 10;
$name = "Tommy";

function get_students_age() {

  return $GLOBALS['name']. " is " .$GLOBALS['age'] ." years old!";
}

echo get_students_age(); //Tommy is 10 years old!

// Apart from accessing global variables, $GLOBALS can be used to modifying them.
// In the same example:
{
  $age = 10;
  $name = "Tommy";

function get_students_age2() {

  return $GLOBALS['name']. " is " .$GLOBALS['age']=12 ." years old!";
}

 echo get_students_age2(); //Tommy is 12 years old!
}

// We can possibly use this superglobal in order to pass variables between functions
// Examples:
{
  function first_number(){
    $GLOBALS['a'] = 1;
    echo "First number: " . $GLOBALS['a']."<br>";
    ++$GLOBALS['a'];

    // NOTE: This is a closure. We'll talk extensively about closures in a later post
    $second_number = function(){
        echo "Second number: ". $GLOBALS['a'];
    };

    $second_number();
  };

 first_number(); // First number: 1, Second number: 2
}

// But there is a better, less verbose, way to do the same thing with the USE keyword.
// Used in an anonymous function the ‘use’ keyword enables us to introduce, in that scope, variables from an outer scope.

{
    function the_first_number(){
      $a = 1;
      echo "First number: " . $a."<br>";
      ++$a;

      // NOTE: This is a closure. We'll talk extensively about closures in a later post
      $the_second_number = function() USE ($a){
          echo "Second number: ". $a;
      };

    $the_second_number();
  };

  the_first_number(); //First number: 1, Second number: 2
}
