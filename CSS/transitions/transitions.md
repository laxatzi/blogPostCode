# Introduction to CSS Transitions

Unlike print media, the internet is a dynamic medium. Elements can bounce or rotate. Menus can drop down. Colors can change values. The best way to achieve any of these is with CSS transitions. With transitions we can control animations' duration and speed.

Transitions enable us to make property changes occurring smoothly and gradually over a certain duration on time, enhancing the interactivity of a page and user experience.

The following is the CSS syntax for transitions:
div {
transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
}
