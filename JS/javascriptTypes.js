//# Converting Types in JavaScript

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed, also known as untyped, language.

// In dynamically typed languages, typing is associated with the variable’s value and not the variable itself.

// Thus, in JavaScript, variables don’t need to specify a certain data type when they are declared.
